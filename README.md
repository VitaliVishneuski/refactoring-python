## General Task Guidelines

* Please, **don't** change the **pipeline definition** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`).
* Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
* A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated.
* While making changes, any files contained inside folder named as `thirdparty` should be ignored. **Do not modify thirdparty classes.** These files are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
* **Unit tests** - Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green.
* **Modifying unit tests** - You can modify tests as long as there is **no change in the behavior (e.g. test assertions)** of the tests. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
* **Logic and behaviour of the code need to be preserved.** Please use unit tests to make sure that nothing is broken. You can use command `python3 -m pytest` to run unit tests.
* Tasks are Python based, and it is NOT mandatory to use the latest version while making code updates, but you are allowed to change version.
* It is desirable but not required to follow Style Guide for Python Code (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)
* **Please do not reformat code.** It makes hard to review code.
